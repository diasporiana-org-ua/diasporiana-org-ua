### ELECTRONIC LIBRARY LABORATORY ( [UA](README.ua.md) )

### üéØ Goal

The goal of the **Diasporiana** project is to preserve and spread the national cultural identity of Ukraine and its people, the main resource of which is the archive of a large number of book editions inherited from Ukrainian emigrants from different countries of the world.

The purpose of this laboratory is to digitize already scanned editions from the Diasporiana resource, namely:
- conversion of material into text form
- image and cover restoration
- recreating of the material in a modern format: epub / fb2 / pdf / docx

### üõü Help

These books were created by volunteers of the [diasporiana.org.ua](https://diasporiana.org.ua/) project based on digital scans and are not funded by the state (at least at the time this text was written).
The project exists thanks to your financial support. We need your help, and sure, you can help the project by reviewing the current information on the website: [diasporiana.org.ua](https://diasporiana.org.ua/dopomoha/)
